This folder contains files for exercises and my solutions for Chapter 1.

Below are my notes from the chapter:

- C files end in .c.
- C files are compiled using the cc _file.c_ syntax.
- Comments are made with // for single line comments or enclosed by /* _comment_ */ for multi-line comments.
- A bit is a 1 or 0.
- A byte is 8 bits (ex. 00101001)
- Define symbolic constants at the top of your file using #define _NAME_ _REPLACEMENT TEXT_
- Use getchar() and putchar() for input/output of characters.
- A text stream is a sequence of characters divided into lines; each line consisting of zero or more characters followed by a newline character
-
